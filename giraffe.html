                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                            <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to 
                            the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal
                             and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
                             Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species,
                              Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. 
                              Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
                               species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA,
                                as well as morphological measurements.Seven other extinct species 
                              of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the Giraffe at pen E27, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
